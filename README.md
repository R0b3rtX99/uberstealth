uberstealth Overview
uberstealth is a plugin for IDA Pro and OllyDbg which aims to hide the debugger from most common anti-debugging techniques. The plugin consists of two files, the plugin itself and a dll which is injected into the debuggee as soon as the debugger attaches to the process. The injected dll actually implements most of the stealth techniques either by hooking system calls or by patching memory in the debuggee.
